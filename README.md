# nosql-api
My modivation for this project was to use a differnt tool to update and collect datat rather than mysql. In this project I use MongoDB to create data which can latter be shown in Insomnia. What I have learned in this projec was how good a MongoDB database is and a tool to be used in later projects. One of the main problem I hand in this project was how I couldnt get the user to show its data. But this was later soleve with carful oversite over my initial code. This project was a good way to show that there are other ways to collect data for project other than mysql.
